Part 1 is working as expected.

I was unable to get part 2 working according to specs, even with an 
additional day's coding past the deadline. I am disappointed, but I 
suspect I'm either missing something fundamental or misunderstanding the 
spec somehow. I've included my work for part2, but be advised that it does 
not compile. You may view my wrangling's with it in the git repository at

Do with it what you will.
