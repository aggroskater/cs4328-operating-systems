========================

Repo for CS4328 OS class with Dr. Ziliang during Fall 2013 at Texas State University.

So far, we've only had one project regarding threads. The project is due 
tomorrow and I haven't even started. And it wants us to do the work in 
Windoze as well. One small problem: I don't have a Windoze box. I haven't had 
a Windoze box since Windoze 7 came out.

"If you wait until the night before the due date, you will have a miserable
night and it is less likely you could complete the project."

Challenge accepted.

Well, time to get to work, I suppose. I'll add in the project requirements 
PDF.

UPDATE: 0500 in the morning. You win Dr. Ziliang... this time.
