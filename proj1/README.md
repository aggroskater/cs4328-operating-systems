Project 1
=========

Part 1: Fibonacci with threads. Honestly, from the project description, this 
isn't really multithreaded programming. Having the main() function sit in a 
thread and wait on ONE other thread to do the fibonacci sequence isn't really 
MULTIthreaded work. And recursively defined functions are pretty much 
anethema to multithreaded work.

Part 2: Matrix multiplication with threads.

Part 3: How many 99s?
