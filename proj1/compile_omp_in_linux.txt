OpenMP is included as a standard library in most gcc complier so it is already on all the CS servers.
You need to write your source code in c and use c libraries instead of c++ libraries. Your source code should have an extension name .c instead of .cpp because gcc compiler might not recognize some of the c++ code.

To give you an example, I included the c version of count99 code. You will see the difference if you compare the c++ version (provided in the proj1.pdf).
Here is how you compile and run an openMP code in Linux:
[zz11@eros OpenMP_Demo_Code]$ gcc -fopenmp -o hello omp_hello.c
[zz11@eros OpenMP_Demo_Code]$ ./hello
Hello World 0 
Hello World 1 
Hello World 2
